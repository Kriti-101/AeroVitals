## üß† AI Stress Detection Algorithm

The system uses machine learning to analyze multiple biometric parameters:

```python
# Feature extraction from sensor data
features = [
    heart_rate_variability,
    oxygen_saturation_trend,
    temperature_deviation,
]

# Stress level classification
stress_level = model.predict(features)
# Output: Normal, Elevated, Critical
```
